# YaST - Qt Software Management

This module provides the graphical (Qt) version of the YaST Package Selector which is used to update, install or delete individual packages.

An overview about package handling in general is available on the [libyui-ncurses-pkg wiki page](https://github.com/libyui/libyui-ncurses-pkg/wiki).
The wiki page also describes common use cases and how to solve the task in YaST Software Management (for Qt as well as ncurses).
Also included is the information about related configuration files.

For details about reported bugs and issues see the wiki page [background](https://github.com/libyui/libyui-ncurses-pkg/wiki/background).
