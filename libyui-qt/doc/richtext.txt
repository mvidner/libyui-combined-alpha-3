The RichText widget in the Qt UI currently supports the tags listed
below. Note that not all of them will make sense for use within YaST.
(Most notably all those which refer to files)

     * <qt>...</qt> - A Qt rich text document. It understands the
       following attributes
          + title - the caption of the document. This attribute is easily
            accessible with [25]QTextView::documentTitle()
          + type - The type of the document. The default type is page .
            It indicates that the document is displayed in a page of its
            own. Another style is detail. It can be used to explain
            certain expressions more detailed in a few sentences. The
            QTextBrowser will then keep the current page and display the
            new document in a small popup similar to QWhatsThis. Note
            that links will not work in documents with <qt type="detail"
            >...</qt>
          + bgcolor - The background color, for example bgcolor="yellow"
            or bgcolor="#0000FF"
          + background - The background pixmap, for example
            background="granit.xpm". The pixmap name will be resolved by
            a [26]QMimeSourceFactory().
          + text - The default text color, for example text="red"
          + link - The link color, for example link="green"
     * <a>...</a> - An anchor or link. The reference target is defined in
       the href attribute of the tag as in \c<a
       href="target.qml">...</a>. You can also specify an additional
       anchor within the specified target document, for example <a
       href="target.qml#123">...</a>. If a is meant to be an anchor, the
       reference source is given in the name attribute.
     * <font>...</font> - Customizes the font size and text color. The
       tag understands two attributes:
          + color - the text color, for example color="red" or
            color="#FF0000".
          + size - the logical size of the font. Logical sizes 1 to 7 are
            supported. The value may either be absolute, for example
            size=3, or relative. In the latter case, the sizes are simply
            added.
     * <em>...</em> - Emphasized. As default, this is the same as
       <i>...</i> (Italic)
     * <strong>...</strong> - Strong. As default, this is the same as
       <bold>...</bold> (bold)
     * <big>...</big> - A larger font size.
     * <small>...</small> - A smaller font size.
     * <code>...</code> - Indicates Code. As default, this is the same as
       <tt>...</tt> (typewriter)
     * <pre>...</pre> - For larger junks of code. Whitespaces in the
       contents are preserved.
     * <large>...</large> - Large font size.
     * <b>...</b> - Bold font style.
     * <h1>...</h1> - A top-level heading.
     * <h2>...</h2> - A sub-level heading.
     * <h3>...</h3> - A sub-sub-level heading.
     * <p>...</p> - A paragraph.
     * <center>...</center> - A centered paragraph.
     * <blockquote>...</blockquote> - An indented paragraph, useful for
       quotes.
     * <multicol cols=n >...</multicol> - Multicol display with n columns
     * <twocolumn>...</twocolumn> - Two-column display.
     * <ul>...</ul> - An un-ordered list. You can also pass a type
       argument to define the bullet style. The default is type=disc,
       other types are circle and square.
     * <ol>...</ol> - An ordered list. You can also pass a type argument
       to define the enumeration label style. The default is type="1",
       other types are "a" and "A".
     * <li>...</li> - A list item.
     * <img/> - An image. The image name for the mime source factory is
       given in the source attribute, for example <img source="qt.xpm"/>
       The image tag also understands the attributes width and height
       that determine the size of the image. If the pixmap does not fit
       to the specified size, it will be scaled automatically.
     * <br/> - A line break
     * <hr/> - A horizonal line
