Qt testsuite

The Qt testsuite test the y2qt component by running all
.ui files in the qt.test directory (qt.test/*.ui) through
runqt.

Every run results in a stdout and stderr output which is
checked agains .out and .err respectively.

The file lib/qt.exp defines a function which runs all tests
contained in qt.test (i.e. makes a 'glob' on qt.test/*.ui)

For every .ui file you put in tests, you must create the proper
.out and .err file with the following command

runqt file.ui > file.out 2> file.err
