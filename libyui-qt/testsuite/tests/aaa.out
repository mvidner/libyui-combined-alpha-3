("After building the test environment new:all make clean, make -f Makefile.cvs, configure --prefix=/,make and make install as root.... there is more information on stderr ...It's a libtool feature :-) When you make a program a script will beinstalled in the source directory which will do the final linkingjust before you run it. (Just do more ui/Qt/qt to see what I mean)\nThe messages are warnings issued by the linker(for some reason these warnings are enabled within SuSE linux). Whenyou run the program a second time, the program is already linked so youwon't get the warnings any more.\nYou can get rid of the warnings by removing the  \"-warn-common\" outof your egcs specfile. No idea why it is in there in the first place.")
