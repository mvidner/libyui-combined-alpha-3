 * making the next lower dialog on the stack visible as when the (previously)
 * topmost main dialog is closed.
 *
 * This widget also handles its own visibility accordingly: It is visible if
 * and only if it has a main dialog to display. It makes itself invisible when
 * there is no more main dialog to display, and it makes itself visible again
 * when a new main dialog appears.
 *
 * This widget can swallow an arbitrary number of main dialogs as they are
 * opened as long as there is no popup dialog in between.
