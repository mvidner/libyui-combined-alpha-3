YWidget generates a core if the widget is created on stack
----------------------------------------------------------


TO DO - Common issues:
----------------------
- Use WidgetFactory create methods, e.g. in NCAskForDirectory/File, NCPkgPopups
- call YUI_CHECK_NEW(() for all with 'new' created widgets, e.g. NCPopuptextEntry


EVENTs
------
TODO: 	remove YCPValue result; from NCursesEvent (check where 'result' is used,
      	maybe a string value can be used)


SelectionBox
------------
selectItem() added  
addItem (string, bool ) added 	
TODO: 	test NCPkgPopupDeps which uses addItem(string, bool) 


NCPopupMenu/NCMenuButton
-------------------------
Don't create NCPopupMenu on the stack - reason see above
store menu selection as YMenuItem in NCursesEvent and create 
an YMenuEvent(YmenuItem) (in  NCtoY2Event )

YNCursesUI.cc
-------------
Don't create NCAskForDirectory/NCAskForExistingFile/NCAskForExistingDirectory
on the stack


NCFrame
-------
whether a frame is strechable or not depends on the children, if a children is
stretchable, the frame also is stretchable
-> NCAskForDirectory/NCAskForFile: setStretchable for NCComboBox true


NCInputField
------------
property 'mayedit' removed, is not supported for InputField - was never 
supported before (for TextEntry) 
param 'initialText' removed
TODO: 	what's the difference between InputMaxLength and maxInputLength ???



NCDialog
--------
don't call 'delete' for helpPopup use deleteTopmostDialog() instead !
TODO:  	check code concerning helpPopup 
        Problem: start example Events.ycp,
                 press F1,
                 timeout event obviously applies to help popup and
                 therefore the richtext widget for shwoing the events
                 cannot be found
           
NCPopupInfo
-----------
doesn't work corretcly if called from NCDialog


NCAskForDirectory/NCAskForFile
------------------------------
- ComboBox entries are added twice
- Don't use widget IDs; compare widget pointers instead



NCMenuButton/NCPopupMenu
------------------------
- what about default button? HuHa: MenuButton cannot be teh default button ->
  code removed
- only dummy rebuildMenuTree() added (should be ok)

TODO: test replace widget
