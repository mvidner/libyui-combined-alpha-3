almost DONE - all UI examples work (correctly or only with minor problems)/
-----------   some further checks/tests required

NCMenuButton
- all examples work correctly - but ChangeWidget has to be tested
  (rebuildTree is a NOP so far)

NCComboBox/NCSelectionBox
- all examples work - but check whether the index is set correctly in any case

PackageSelector
- layout is created with the widget factory or by creating the NCWidgets directly

FIXME:
- fix NCPkgPopupDeps::showSolutions()

TODO:
- implement createYouLayout()
- test hyperlinks ("pkg:") 

TESTED:
- Filter menu works
- Actions menu works
- Information menu works
- Etc menu works
- "Solving ..." popup in NCPkgPopupDeps() is shown correctly
- "Automatic changes" popup OK 
- "License agreement" popup OK


TESTED - all UI examples tested/unsolved problems exist
------
EVENTs (class NCursesEvent, example Events.ycp)
- example works correctly except of a problem with NCPopupInfo on F1 
  Strange things happen: 1. when a timout event is sent,
                         2. if F1 or ESC is pressed again
  			
  The reason for this behaviour is probably a reentrance problem, because the 
  popup with a new userInput() (see NCPopup::popupDialog()) is called in 
  NCDialog::userInput() itself.
  Possible solution: don't call NCPopupInfo directly in NCDialog::processInput()
  but set a timer and show the popup after the NCDialog::userInput() is finished. 


MORE tests required
-------------------
ENCODING correct (UTF-8 encoding/NCstring) ??? - both for input(e.g. NCInputField) 
and text output, setLanguage() moved
test ChangeWidget for every widget
